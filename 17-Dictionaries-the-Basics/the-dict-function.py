'''
In this lesson, we'll introduce the DECT function, which allows us to create a dictionary object from

an argument, recall that we have a similar list function to convert an input to a list and a string

function to convert an input to a string.

print(dict()) # prints an empty dictionary
employee_titles = [
    
    ["mary", "sr developer"],
    ["len", "jr developer"],
    ["fatima", "janitor"]
]

print(dict(employee_titles))
